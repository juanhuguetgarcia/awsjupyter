# README

This are a set of materials put together between the contributors to give a gentle introduction to deep learning and neural networks in the s2ds pivigo's program at Westminster University.

1. Introduction to neural networks - Jan Sauer
2. [Setting up a cloud environment for deep learning - Juan Huguet](setupjupyteraws.ipynb)
3. Image classification: Shallow learning with sklearn vs. deep learning with tensorflow - A. Campello

Go to the notebooks and enjoy!
